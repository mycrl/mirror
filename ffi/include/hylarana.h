     * components. Y′ (with prime) is distinguished from Y, which is
     * luminance, meaning that light intensity is nonlinearly encoded based
     * on gamma corrected RGB primaries.
     *
     * Y′CbCr color spaces are defined by a mathematical coordinate
     * transformation from an associated RGB primaries and white point. If
     * the underlying RGB color space is absolute, the Y′CbCr color space
     * is an absolute color space as well; conversely, if the RGB space is
     * ill-defined, so is Y′CbCr. The transformation is defined in
     * equations 32, 33 in ITU-T H.273. Nevertheless that rule does not
     * apply to P3-D65 primaries used by Netflix with BT.2020-NCL matrix,
     * so that means matrix was not derived from primaries, but now Netflix
     * allows BT.2020 primaries (since 2021). The same happens with
     * JPEG: it has BT.601 matrix derived from System M primaries, yet the
     * primaries of most images are BT.709.

     * Pulse-code modulation
     *
     * Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent
     * analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in
     * computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio
     * applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is
     * sampled at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to the
     * nearest value within a range of digital steps.
     *
     * Linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM in which
     * the quantization levels are linearly uniform. This is in contrast to
     * PCM encodings in which quantization levels vary as a function of
     * amplitude (as with the A-law algorithm or the μ-law algorithm).
     * Though PCM is a more general term, it is often used to describe data
     * encoded as LPCM.
     *
     * A PCM stream has two basic properties that determine the stream's
     * fidelity to the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is
     * the number of times per second that samples are taken; and the bit
     * depth, which determines the number of possible digital values that
     * can be used to represent each sample.
